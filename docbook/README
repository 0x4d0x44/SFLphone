TIPS

I already created page samples. Each docbook document represents a chapter in the user manual. The file manual.docbook is the main file, and includes all the chapters to build one document.



# Adding a new chapter

Create a new file new-chapter.docbook. Copy the squeleton of an other docbook file if needed. These files are xml-based files. Here is a link to a quick overview of the syntax to use:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-docbk.html.
Then add your new file reference in manual.docbook (at the beginning and at the end)
You are done!



# Generating the manual

You may need to install sgmltools-lite package: sudo apt-get install sgmltools-lite
Run: 
					sgmltools -b html manual.docbook

It will output HTML files in the manual directory.



Enjoy !
