Partnership
-----------

A partnership between Savoir-Faire Linux and the *Polytechnic school* of Montreal will begin in January 2008.  

Five students from Polytechnic school will be working part-time on the project for a period of four months.

Goals
-----
- The technical goal of this partnership is to implement a video layer in SFLphone to allow *video calls* and *video conferencing*. It is an interesting challenge because videoconference is not much implemented in softphones yet. The first step consists in implementing peer-to-peer video calls.  

- This is how the application should behave on a client side:
  * The user opens a multimedia session with an other client (SIP protocol)
  * Local video capture (video4linux2 driver) is compressed and shipped through RTP packets.
  * In the same time, the incoming video stream (in RTP packets also) is decompressed and displayed.
  * The visualization framework should be flexible and should allow user parametrization. 3D API OpenGL should be used.
