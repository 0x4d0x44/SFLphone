If you need to update the translations files :

First, compile the KDE client in order to update generated c++ files (from ui files, etc).
For more details about how to compile KDE client, see the README file in sflphone-client-kde folder.
Then just execute:

	./update.sh
	
in the current directory.


Now that the global po files are updated, you can copy them in both Gnome and KDE clients using :

	./copy-in-gnome.sh

and

	./copy-in-kde.sh

This will replace the po files in clients with those in lang folder.

ALL CHANGES MADE DIRECTLY IN PO FILES IN THE CLIENTS FOLDERS WILL BE LOST!
