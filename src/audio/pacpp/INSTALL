GNU(/Linux) build notes:
------------------------

Change to the 'build/gnu' directory.

Make sure the configure script is executable by running 'chmod +x configure'.

Run './configure' to create the Makefile. If this doesn't work out for you, run
'autoconf' first to recreate the configure script.

Run 'make' to create all the test programs in the 'examples' directory, as well
as the static and dynamic libraries in the 'lib' directory. 

Run 'make docs' to generate the Doxygen HTML documentation. And 'make clean' does
the normal thing too.

Currently, PortAudioCpp compiles under g++-2.95 as well as g++-3.3. The setup still
needs testing under Darwin (I don't know how the library dependencies work on the Mac).

MS Visual C++ 6.0 build notes:
------------------------------

Open either one of the .dsp files in the /build/vc6/ folder. Simply select 
Build->Build ... (F7) to build the project.

These projects assume you have downloaded and installed PortAudio V19 in a folder called 
``portaudio_v19'', which must be a `sibling' folder of this (the ``PortAudioCpp'') 
folder. If this is not the case, you will have to edit the ``Additional include directories'' 
field from the projects settings (Project->Settings...->C/C++ tab->Preprocessor category).

To compile the dynamic-link library project, you'll either have to include the source 
files needed from PortAudio V19, or link against a pre-compiled library of PortAudio V19.

The output files (.lib or .dll and .lib) will be placed in the /lib/ folder.
