x1) Pa_HostApiTypeIdToHostApiIndex() should probably return a PaError and 
there should be an additional error code called paHostApiNotFoundError. 
Currently the function returns -1 on error, but there's no corresponding 
PaError (this is a minor issue for PaCpp as all exceptions are mappings of 
corresponding PaError codes).

x2.1) Pa_CountHostApis() should probably be renamed Pa_GetHostApiCount(), because 
the actual counting of host apis is done in Pa_Initialize().

x2.2) Pa_CountDevices() should probably be renamed Pa_GetDeviceCount(), because 
the actual counting of devices is done in Pa_Initialize().

x3) Pa_CountDevices() should probably return a PaError on error, instead of returning 0.
Host apis might very well have 0 devices (like the `skeleton implementation' host api).

4) PaAsio_GetAvailableLatencyValues() uses the term `latency' for number of frames per buffer 
values which isn't the same as `latency' in the rest of PA.

5) Possibly rename Pa_GetStreamReadAvailable() to Pa_GetStreamAvailableReadSize() and 
Pa_GetStreamWriteAvailable() to Pa_GetStreamAvailableWriteSize().

x6) Input void *'s (in callback function prototype and blocking i/o write method) should 
probably be const void *'s.
