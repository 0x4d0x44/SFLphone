/** @mainpage SFLphone GTK+ Client Documentation 
  * SFLphone GTK+ Client was started as a debuging tool for the new dbus API but
  * ended being a full featured client.  
  * @section intro_sec Architecture
  * SFLphone respects the MVC principle.  Since the internal workings and the UI 
  * are too different programs, dbus is used to exchange data between them.  Dbus
  * is thereby inforcing MVC by only allowing access to high level functions and data.
  *
  * Therefore, when a button is clicked, a direct dbus API call should happen 
  * (defined in dbus.h).  The UI should only be updated when signals are received 
  * from dbus.  The call back to those signals are defined in dbus.c, but they call
  * functions in actions.h.  This makes things cleaner as one signal could have many 
  * actions.
  *
  * Accounts are stored in form of a account_t in an account list with access functions
  * defined in accountlist.h.
  *
  * Calls are stored in form of a call_t in a call list with access functions defined
  * in calllist.h.

/** @file marshaller.h
  * @brief This file contains marshallers functions for dbus signals.
  * This file is generated by glib-genmarshall. 
  * Every dbus signal has to have a marshaller.  To generate a new marshaller function, 
  * add its signature to the marshaller.list.  Then run :
  * <pre>glib-genmarshal --body --g-fatal-warnings marshaller.list > marshaller.c</pre>
  * <pre>glib-genmarshal --header --g-fatal-warnings marshaller.list > marshaller.h</pre>
  * to get the generated marshallers.
  * Just before connecting to the dbus signal, register the marshaller with: 
  * dbus_g_object_register_marshaller().
