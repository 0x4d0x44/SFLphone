How to compile SFLphone ?
-------------------------

./configure [option]
make
make install (as root) 
  ( Be sure you have the correct permissions).


How to use it ?
---------------

If you have old version, remove your sflphonerc file located in $HOME/.sflphone

1. Lauch it, a setup window appears. 

2. If you do have a SIP account, fill the SIP stuff where related. You can use
   STUN too.

3. Save your settings, restart it. You're done.

A user's guide will be available on:

Why does it not compile ?
-------------------------

	- You don't have the same library versions as we do.
	  See http://www.sflphone.org in section Downloads.

	- You don't have the same compiler (some libraries dislike
	  some compilers). We are using  gcc 3.3.3 on
	  Fedora Core 2 Linux. Someone reported it works on gcc 3.4.

	- If error occured while loading shared libraries,
	  you have to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH with your lib directory.
	  ( example: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} )

	- If you don't install dependencies in classic install directories,
	  you have to export CXXFLAGS. 
	  ( example: export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/include" )


Short description of content of source tree:
-------------------------------------------

- skins/ contains the different available skins in separated directories.
- pixmaps/ contains all the pixmaps used in the configuration window.
- rings/ contains the different ringtones.
- stund/ is an implementation of the protocol STUN used when there is a NAT.
- utilspp/ allows to implement a singleton.

- src/ is the core of SFLphone. It contains the main.cpp, managerimpl.cpp files,  audio and gui directories, and files about signalisation SIP. 
  Later, it should be better, when IAX will be implemented, that a directory 
  groups these protocols. 
  The ManagerImpl class is the intermediaire between all the layer in the tree.

- src/audio/ is the audio layer. It contains all about tones, dtmf, audiodriver,  rtp layer, audio codec ulaw, alaw and gsm.
- src/audio/gsm/ contains the implementation of gsm audiocodec library.
- src/audio/pacpp/ implements PortAudioCpp, a native C++ binding of 
  PortAudio V19.

- src/gui/ is the directory that contains all about different user interface.
  The GuiFramework class is the base class of all user interface objects. It
  receives mouse, keyboard events from GUI child class and calls ManagerImpl 
  functions which correspond. GuiFramework receives also events from ManagerImpl
  and handle them according to the GUI chosen by the user, with virtual 
  functions.
- src/gui/qt is the implementation of QT user interface.


How is structured SFLphone (>=0.4)
----------------------------------

		+------+	+--------+
		|GUI Qt|	|GUI text|	...  
		+------+ 	+--------+
			|			|		
		+---------------------------+	
		|		GUI Framework		|
		+---------------------------+
					|
		+---------------------------+
		|		ManagerImpl			|  
		+---------------------------+
					|
		+---------------------------+
		|		VoIPLink			|
		+---------------------------+
			|					|
		+-----------+ 		+-------+
		|	SIP		|		|  IAX	|
		|	RTP		|		+-------+
		|	STUN	|
		+-----------+

It's in ManagerImpl where we declared Call vector and VoIPLink vector.
VoIPLink vector contains all different VoIP link like SIP, IAX, ...
Call vector contains all the calls according to the kind of VoIP link.
