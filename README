This is SFLPhone 0.1 alpha. A new softphone.

WARNING!!!
This software is extremely alpha, as its name says.
You will experience lots of trouble while (or even before) running it.
This is the game. But hopefully someday you will enjoy
using sflphone on your desktop.

Only OSS audio is supported for now.

How to compile it ?
----------------

./configure -oss
make
make install 
  ( Be sure you have the correct permissions).


How to use it ?
---------------
1. Lauch it and click on SETUP. 
   Go to Audio, choose OSS (if you don't it WILL crash, this is a small bug,
   don't forget, it's alpha). 

2. If you do have a SIP account, fill the SIP stuff where related. You can use
   STUN too.

3. Save your settings, restart it. You're done.

A full documentation will be available later on http://www.sflphone.org


Why does it not compile ?
-------------------------
	- You don't have the same library versions as we do.
	  See http://www.sflphone.org in section Downloads.

	- You don't have the same compiler (some libraries dislike
	  some compilers). We are using  gcc 3.3.3 on
	  Fedora Core 2 Linux. Someone reported it works on gcc 3.4.

	- You don't have luck as we cannot help you before
	  January, 5th 2005 because we are on *holidays*.

Of course we love patches. And contribution. See http://www.sflphone.org/ .    
We are setting up the project (CVS, bugtraqer, MLs) infrastructure.
Please be patient. The goal was to release an early alpha version before the
holidays so we can get some feedback.
