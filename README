Introduction
------------

SFLPhone is a Voice-over-IP software phone. We want it to be:
- user friendly (fast, sleek, easy to learn interface)
- corporate grade (transfers, holds, perfect audio quality)
- fully compatible with Asterisk (SIP and IAX protocols)
- customizable 

As the SIP/audio daemon and the user interface are separate processes,
it is easy to provide different user interfaces. SFLPhone0.8 comes with
a GTK graphical user interface, an interactive command line interface,
and even scripts to control the daemon from the shell.

SFLPhone is actually used by the support team of Savoir-Faire Linux Inc.

Short description of content of source tree
-------------------------------------------

- ringtones/ contains the different ringtones.
- stund/ is an implementation of the protocol STUN used when there is a NAT.
- utilspp/ allows to implement a singleton.
- src/ is the core of SFLphone. It contains the main.cpp, managerimpl.cpp
  files, audio and gui directories, and files about signalisation SIP. Later,
  it should be better, when IAX will be implemented, that a directory groups
  these protocols. 
  The ManagerImpl class is the intermediaire between all the layer in the tree.
- src/audio/ is the audio layer. It contains all about tones, dtmf,
  audiodriver, rtp layer, audio codec ulaw, alaw and gsm.
