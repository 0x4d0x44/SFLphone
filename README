How to compile SFLphone ?
-------------------------

./configure [option]
make
make install (as root) 
  ( Be sure you have the correct permissions).


How to use it ?
---------------

If you have old version, remove your sflphonerc file located in $HOME/.sflphone

1. Lauch it, a setup window appears. 

2. If you do have a SIP account, fill the SIP stuff where related. You can use
   STUN too.

3. Save your settings, restart it. You're done.

Why does it not compile ?
-------------------------
	- You don't have the same library versions as we do.
	  See http://www.sflphone.org in section Downloads.

	- You don't have the same compiler (some libraries dislike
	  some compilers). We are using  gcc 3.3.3 on
	  Fedora Core 2 Linux. Someone reported it works on gcc 3.4.

	- If error occured while loading shared libraries,
	  you have to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH with your lib directory.
	  ( example: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} )

	- If you don't install dependencies in classic install directories,
	  you have to export CXXFLAGS. 
	  ( example: export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/include" )

Of course we love patches. And contribution. See http://www.sflphone.org/ .
