Description: IAX2 protocol support for SFLphone
 Inter Asterisk eXchange, lovingly called IAX (pronounced: eeks), is the 
 protocol used by the Asterisk PBX system for inter-asterisk-communication.
 Other applications may use libiax to communicate with each other and 
 other asterisk servers.  
 IAX is a high performance, feature rich protocol unrelated to SIP or H.323.
 Its single-socket design allows it to interoperate with NAT and 
 PAT masquerade firewalls. It supports internationalization, remote dialplans, 
 and voice, HTML, image, DTMF, and video content.
 This library is needed by SFLphone to support the IAX2 protocol.
 SFLphone is being developed by the global community, and maintained by 
 Savoir-faire Linux, a Montreal, Quebec, Canada-based Linux consulting company.
 This package is only the library development files.
